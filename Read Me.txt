This is the ENSF480 Final Project submission package for group 20. To run the program, you must change some attributes first.

1. in bin/database/Database.java, you must update the DBURL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD values in the constructor to fit your MySQL setup.

2. you must create the database as given in lib/database and you can also implement the test queries to test requirements. 

		Please Ensure that you recompile the Database.java code after completing these steps. 


The program will run and meets all requirements, as shown in the submission video. However the longer the program runs the
 more likely it is to have a glitchy GUI do to the heavy operation load, this is easily fixed by restarting the program 
 for every test case you would like to do. 

As requested, there is a .jar file in this package to run the program. However the source codes have also been provided in thier
 respective directories.

To run the program from the command line, without the .jar file, do as follows.
1. enter the folder where only bin, lib, this Read Me, and the .jar are visible
2. enter the following commands: 
	to compile: javac -cp .:lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar bin/control/*.java bin/database/*.java bin/gui/*.java bin/domain/*.java
      
      	to run: java -cp .;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar bin/gui/Main
